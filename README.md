# Task Description
To create an object constructor function named Shoes. Within this object, create the following properties:
•	Name
•	Product code
•	Quantity
•	Value per item

Then, create five instances of the Shoes object and push all of them to an array.

Then create the following functions that can interact with the array:
•	A function to search for any shoe within the array.
•	A function to find the shoe with the lowest value per item.
•	A function to find the shoe with the highest value per item.
•	A function to edit all four properties for each of the five shoe instances.
•	A function to order all the objects in ascending order based on the “Value per item” property.

Keep in mind that when running these functions, all of your outputs should display all the results in an easy-to-read manner in the console.
